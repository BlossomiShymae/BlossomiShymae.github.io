  <h1>About Blossomi Shymae</h1>
  <p><span class="text-pink">she/her</span> | <span class="text-greenish">INFP</span></p>

  <p>Shymae is the first name of the pseudonym, hehe. I'm a very shy trans lady that wants to be herself. I primarily code but I also like to digitally draw sometimes.... {{ `>.<` }}</p>
  <p>I'm literally a real life <a href="https://anilist.co/character/257562/Hitori-Gotou">Hitori Goto</a> or <a href="https://anilist.co/character/128986/Bocchi-Hitori">Bocchi Hitori</a> but older.
  It is very hard to share, talk, or discuss anything without catastrophizing. The feeling of wanting friends but also being unable to be yourself is very heartbreaking.... :c</p>
  
  <p>I can be found in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/riotgamesdevrel">Riot Games Third Party Developer Community Discord</a>.</p>
